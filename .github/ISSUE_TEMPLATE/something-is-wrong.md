name: Bug report
about: Incorrect information, something not thought out, etc

---

**Summarize the issue as briefly and concisely as you can**  
e.g. The description of PixHawk avionics in the `data/avionics/hardware.md`
file is invalid because it was not designed with high vibration in mind.

**How many other files/information points will this affect when fixed?**  
1, 2, 3, many

**Could there have been other mistakes that lead to this?  If so, what?**  
e.g. "High vibration" is not properly defined somewhere
