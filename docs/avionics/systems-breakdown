AVIONICS SYSTEMS BREAKDOWN

1. Telemetry: Sending & receiving signals to/from Rocket; save data to rocket HDD and ground computer as well as format the received raw data into something readable and useful on the ground computer
- Important data to be considered - Altitude, velocity, and acceleration

2. Engine: Control the fuel for the engine

3. Recovery: What altitude/atmospheric pressure to deploy parachutes

4. Abort procedure: A system to release fuel, separate nose-cone with the electronics containing data, and initiate recovery procedure in the event of launch path failure

And just to be clear, we have recently confirmed that we will not be controlling the movement of the rocket at all during flight.
