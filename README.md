# Research

Welcome to the general-purpose research repository.  Inititally, this is being created to facilitate group-visible storage of links, ideas, and stuff to remember.  As it grows, I'm hopeful that it'll actually be helpful to someone.

# Structure

Because this is not really a code repository, the general organization should be as follows to keep things findable:

```
Research repo
 |
 +- .git
 | +- Github files, README, etc.
 +- data
 | +- avionics
 | +- programming-languages
 | +- etc...
```

The general idea is to keep all the data under the `data` folder, categorized by **sensible and understandable** names.
